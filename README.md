The Game

The **Latin Square Activity** is a mathematical puzzle game that challenges players to fill in missing values in a grid, following specific rules. The game is designed to test both logical reasoning and mathematical skills as players advance through various levels with increasing difficulty.

**Game Mechanics:**  
- Players are presented with a matrix that contains missing values. Between each cell, operators (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) are displayed.
- The result of each row is shown at the right side of the grid, and the result of each column is shown at the bottom.
- The objective is for players to fill in the missing values so that each equation is satisfied.
